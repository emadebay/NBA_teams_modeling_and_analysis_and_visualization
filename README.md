🏀 NBA Player & Team Performance Analysis
📋 Overview

This project analyzes NBA player and team statistics to uncover insights into performance trends, efficiency metrics, and predictive indicators of success. Using Python for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling, and Tableau for visualization, the project provides an interactive way to explore player impact, team dynamics, and season performance.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze player-level performance metrics (points, assists, rebounds, efficiency, etc.).

Compare team offensive and defensive efficiency across seasons.

Predict team success using regression and feature engineering.

Create an interactive Tableau dashboard for data exploration.

🧠 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed raw NBA data using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Predictive Modeling: Built regression models to predict team win percentages.

Advanced Metrics: Calculated player efficiency ratings, true shooting percentage (TS%), and usage rate.

Interactive Visualization: Published dashboards in Tableau for intuitive exploration.

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Tableau

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

📊 Results

Identified key features (e.g., FG%, turnovers, rebounds) most correlated with team wins.

Built a predictive model with over 85% accuracy in estimating win outcomes.

Developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize player impact and team trends interactively.
